    * requiring a full dedicated domain ?
    * architectures not supported ?
    * not-working single-sign on or LDAP integration ?
    * the app requires an important amount of RAM / disk / .. to install or to work properly
    * etc...

* Other infos that people should be aware of, such as:
    * any specific step to perform after installing (such as manually finishing the install, specific admin credentials, ...)
    * how to configure / administrate the application if it ain't obvious
    * upgrade process / specificities / things to be aware of ?
    * security considerations ?

## Settings and upgrades

Almost everything related to PyInventory's configuration is handled in a `"../conf/settings.py"` file.
You can edit the file `/opt/yunohost/pyinventory/local_settings.py` to enable or disable features.

Test sending emails:

```bash
ssh admin@yourdomain.tld
root@yunohost:~# cd /opt/yunohost/pyinventory/
root@yunohost:/opt/yunohost/pyinventory# source venv/bin/activate
(venv) root@yunohost:/opt/yunohost/pyinventory# ./manage.py sendtestemail --admins
```

Background info: Error mails are send to all [settings.ADMINS](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/settings/#std:setting-ADMINS). By default the YunoHost admin is inserted here.
To check current ADMINS run:

```bash
(venv) root@yunohost:/opt/yunohost/pyinventory# ./manage.py sendtestemail --admins
```

If you prefere to send error emails to a extrnal email address, just do something like this:

```bash
echo "ADMINS = (('Your Name', 'example@domain.tld'),)" >> /opt/yunohost/pyinventory/local_settings.py
```

To check the effective settings, run this:
```bash
(venv) root@yunohost:/opt/yunohost/pyinventory# ./manage.py diffsettings
```

## SSO authentication

* First user (`$YNH_APP_ARG_ADMIN`) will be created as Django's super user
